# PythonML
The *python_first_two_days* branch shows what I learned in my first two days (ever) using python.
It involves manipulating large sparse data, removing columns, running multiple k means analyses on the full data set and subsets, generating reports and saving reports

The master branch is simple code I write for statisticians so that they can focus on their main taskm rather than writing code.
