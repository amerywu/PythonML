###  File Naming Conventions

I will reorganize the code today. We will all follow the following conventions
#### IMPORTANT AND REQUIRED:

#### Shared Code
Shared code are files containing functions we may all use.
The naming convention is:
**AnalysisType_package_Author.py

e.g.  
- kmeans_sklearn_jake.py
- lda_gensim_jerry.py

If code is not analysis then it is either reporting/visualization, datamanipulation, or other.
So you may have a file which is:

reporting_screeplots_matplotlib_minjeong.py
datamanipulation_pandas_hsunfu.py

NOTE: Adding the author name is not conventional. Eventually, we will start merging code. Even now, however, it is OK to use other people's code now. In fact, that's the whole point of git!

Trust me. After a day or two, you will see why this is totally worthwhile.....just as our move to Python was worthwhile.

### Reasons for GitHub:
1. Version control and naming conventions  are universal standard professional practice. It's an important little tool for your toolkit.
2. Without Github, the code base will rapidly become an unusable mess. You will all end up with code sets that cannot be shared.

### Learning Curve
This will probably take two or three hours to learn....maybe a bit more, maybe less. You don't need to learn everything.
Learn:
pull
add
commit
push
and eventually learn branch
That's it

### Using Git
IMPORTANT: Start by using the command line (i.e., the black DOS window)!! Trust me, learning will be easier. However, PyCharm will know you have git and let you use it in  PyCharm. Once you have mastered git, feel free to just use  PyCharm... or any other way you like

### Learning Steps:
Each tutorial will take 20 minutes. Complete in order.
