###  File Naming Conventions

We will all follow the following conventions
#### IMPORTANT AND REQUIRED:

#### Shared Code
Shared code are files containing functions we may all use.
The naming convention is:

- AnalysisType_package_Author.py

e.g.  
- kmeans_sklearn_jake.py
- lda_gensim_jerry.py

If code is not analysis then it is either reporting/visualization, datamanipulation, or other.
So you may have a file which is:

- reporting_screeplots_matplotlib_minjeong.py
- datamanipulation_pandas_hsunfu.py

NOTE: Adding the author name is not conventional. Eventually, we will start merging code. Even now, however, it is OK to use other people's code. In fact, that's the whole point of git!

#### Your Pipeline Code
You will also have pipelines. These are the python files that you actually run with the green triangle button. Often the pipeline is linear code, it does not include functions. Where functions are used, you import them from our other files or from external packages.

The naming convention is:
- AnalysisType_package_Author_pipeline.py

e.g.  
- kmeans_sklearn_jake_pipeline.py



### Reasons for GitHub:
1. Version control and naming conventions  are universal standard professional practice. It's an important little tool for your toolkit.
2. Without Github, the code base will rapidly become an unusable mess. You will all end up with code sets that cannot be shared.

### Learning Curve
This will probably take two or three hours to learn....maybe a bit more, maybe less. You don't need to learn everything.
Learn:
- pull
- add
- commit
- push
- and eventually learn branch
That's it

### Using Git
IMPORTANT: Start by using the command line (i.e., the black DOS window)!! Trust me, learning will be easier. However, PyCharm will know you have git and let you use it in  PyCharm. Once you have mastered git, feel free to just use  PyCharm... or any other way you like

### Learning Steps:
Each tutorial will take 20 minutes. Complete in order.
